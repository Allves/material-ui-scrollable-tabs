# Roadmap

At this time, this project is not intended to be a long-term, ongoing effort.  The goals of the project are to provide a stable scrollable tabs extension for material-ui
for use in the short-term.  The long-term hope is that this project will be absorbed into material-ui proper and will thereafter deprecated.  To that end, this roadmap will
serve as a guide laying out the framework for those goals:

- [x] Remove all content from material-ui that does not pertain to this standalone library
- [x] Post repository to github
- [ ] Add comment to material-ui issues log referencing this feature
- [ ] Post package to npm
- [ ] Merge changed components into material-ui proper
- [ ] Add additional updates to conform to material-ui PR standards
- [ ] Create PR for material-ui
- [ ] material-ui PR acceptance
- [ ] Mark this library as deprecated and unmaintained
