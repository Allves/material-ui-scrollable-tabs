# Roadmap

At this time, this project is not intended to be a long-term, ongoing effort.  The goals of the project are to provide a stable scrollable tabs extension for Material-UI
for use in the short-term.  The long-term hope is that this project will be absorbed into Material-UI proper and will thereafter deprecated.  To that end, this roadmap will
serve as a guide laying out the framework for those goals:

- [x] Remove all content from Material-UI that does not pertain to this standalone library
- [x] Post repository to github
- [x] Add comment to Material-UI issues log referencing this feature
- [x] Post package to npm
- [x] Create examples of use
- [ ] Deprecate isLargeView prop in favor of automatic detection of view size
- [ ] Refactor scrollbar measurements as separate react component or module
- [ ] Get listed as related project of Material-UI
- [ ] Create _next_ branch of this project based on Material-UI next branch
- [ ] Merge _next_ branch of this project into Material-UI next branch
- [ ] Create PR for Material-UI
- [ ] Material-UI PR acceptance
- [ ] Mark this library as deprecated and unmaintained
