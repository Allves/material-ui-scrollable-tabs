###### Component Fixes / Enhancements

- Corrected `fixed` width tabs so that no scrolling behavior occurs. Previously, selecting a partially out of view tab would scroll that tab into view. @shawnmcknight

###### Examples

- Created `/examples` directory with a webpack-dev-server based site that will show interactive examples and code for various tab permutations. Docs for use are [here](https://github.com/STORIS/material-ui-scrollable-tabs/blob/master/examples/README.md). @shawnmcknight
